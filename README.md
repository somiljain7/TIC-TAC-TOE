# TIC-TAC-TOE
 IMPLEMENTATION USING MINIMAX ALGORITHM (GAME TREE)

MINIMAX ALGORITHM
 To check whether or not the current move is better than the best move we take the help of minimax() function which 
 will consider all the possible ways the game can go and returns the best value for that move, assuming the opponent
 also plays optimally.To create an AI player, we need to mimic how a human would think when playing a tic-tac-toe game.
 In real life, a human would think of all the possible consequences for each move. This is where the minimax algorithm
 comes handy. The minimax algorithm is a decision rule used to determine the best possible move in games where all
 possible moves can be foreseen like tic-tac-toe or chess.
